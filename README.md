# ServerClient_Modell
A simple client communication over a server they connected with, can be compared with a whatsapp group chat. To get IP and Port of server the client first has to connect to a config-server which stores all ips and ports of the servers (who wrote their ip and port to it) in a txt-document(key-value pairs: "server.ip 127.0.0.1" etc.). The servers themselves can determine a admin-client which can write the message "PWRDWNSYS" that shuts down the server. The admin client can also be written into the txt-file(like:"server.admin adminClient"), so you don't have to determine the admin client in the server.
